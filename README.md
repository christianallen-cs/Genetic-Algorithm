Created a genetic algorithms that provides probabilistic solutions to optimization problems. These algorithms can be thought of as an advanced “guess and check” technique that eventually arrives at an output that is close to the actual solution without having to know how to compute the solution directly. This algorithm was written in such a way that it can be reused for any application suitable for a genetic algorithm.
